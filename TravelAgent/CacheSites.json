We also did a bus tour for 10 hours, on which we learn quarter of the information we received on our 4 hour walking tour. ... Really enjoyed the walking tour.

The cruise stop is about 5 minutes walk away. Including the bridge next to the Glico man (Ebisu bridge) you will walk under three bridges and just before you reach bridge four (Nihonbashi bridge), there is the Dotonbori 2 cruise stop.
